## MECAZON
One of the biggest projects we've ever tackled in the West-Mec Coding technical program was MECAZON. Instead of this being an individual project that each student completed solo, it was a class-wide team effort. The project was meant to mimmick the feeling of being in a professional environment and working within a team of about fifteen or sixteen developers to complete one website.

## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the West-Mec student's capability to design a fully functional website, dividing up tasks among teams and leading each other to success. My team's purpose was specifically to develop the react components that the final product would incorporate heavilly. In our team, I was assigned with creating the file structure and creating specific components. On top of that, I assisted heavily in the shopping cart functionality of the website by coding the necessary logic.

## Technologies Used and Why
* React: At this point in the program, we'd transitioned from creating most of our projects in JavaScript to creating a large portion of them with react. It was decided by the instructor early on that, if we were going to commence with the creation of the project, react would be more optimal than JavaScript. Also, given the scope of the project and how much ground each team covered with each of their assigned tasks, react seemed like the natural technology to use in this situation.
* MongoDB: Naturally, we'd learned so much of MongoDB at this point that it was only a matter of time before we implemented it into a large project like this. Besides, it seemed like the most appropriate technology to use for such a large set of data.
* Canva: Since the team working on styling couldn't style our components until we were finished coding them properly, most of the design of the page was laid out in Canva files.
